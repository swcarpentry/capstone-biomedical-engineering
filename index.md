> ## Learning Objectives {.objectives}
> * Apply the core software carpentry skills in the field of biomedical engineering.
> * Loading .mat-files 
> * Logical indexing

Now that we know a few fundmentals of MATLAB, we can load other researchers' data to explore it further.  We can process data for visualization and take advantage of MATLAB's own code exchange to run the visualization.
